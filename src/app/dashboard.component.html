            Based on swimmers' best times, the app determines the target splits for an entered distance.
             Then, it converts them based on the pool configuration (short course yards, short course meters, long course meters). 
             It also considers target splits for individual medley (butterfly, backstroke, breastroke, freestyle) events. 
             Then, the swim coach can enter the number of repetitions, the amount of rest between each repetition, and the pace to hold within each repetition. 
             Swim coaches can also import/export CSV files, so they can update personal bests and other information about the workout.

          Based on a swimmer's time trial time, the app determines pacing for five different levels of effort in practice: white (easy), pink (moderate), red (endurance), blue (threshold), purple (race pace).
          Swim coaches can also import/export CSV files, so they can update time trial information and receive adjusted pacing. These workouts are inspired by Jon Urbanchek, Head Coach of the University of Michigan
           Swimming and Diving Team from 1982 to 2004.
